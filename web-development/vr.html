  <h1>Virtual Reality</h1>
  <p>
    Virtual Reality (VR) is a computer-generated environment with scenes and objects that appear to be real, making the user feel they are immersed in their surroundings.
    This environment is perceived through a device known as a Virtual Reality headset or helmet.

          <h3>Non-Immersive Virtual Reality</h3>
          <h5>This category is often overlooked as VR simply because itâ€™s so common.
            Non-immersive VR technology features a computer-generated virtual environment where the user simultaneously remains aware and controlled by their physical environment.
            Video games are a prime example of non-immersive VR.</h5>

          <h3>Semi-Immersive Virtual Reality</h3>
          <h5>This type of VR provides an experience partially based in a virtual environment. 
            This type of VR makes sense for educational and training purposes with graphical computing and large projector systems, such as flight simulators for pilot trainees.</h5>

          <h3>Fully Immersive Virtual Reality</h3>
          <h5>Right now, there are no completely immersive VR technologies, but advances are so swift that they may be right around the corner. This type of VR generates the most realistic simulation experience, from sight to sound to sometimes even olfactory sensations. Car racing games are an example of immersive virtual reality that gives the user the sensation of speed and driving skills.
            Developed for gaming and other entertainment purposes, VR use in other sectors is increasing.</h5>
