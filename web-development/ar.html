     <b>Augmented Reality</b>, or “AR”, is exactly what you would expect – technology designed to augment your reality. 
      <br>Unlike virtual reality, in which users step into new virtual worlds, AR brings digital content into your existing environment.
     An Augmented Reality  application 
      will implement visual, auditory, and other sensory information into the world to enhance your experience.

          <h3>Non-Immersive Virtual Reality</h3>
          <h5>This category is often overlooked as VR simply because it’s so common.
            Non-immersive VR technology features a computer-generated virtual environment where the user simultaneously remains aware and controlled by their physical environment.
            Video games are a prime example of non-immersive VR.</h5>

          <h3>Semi-Immersive Virtual Reality</h3>
          <h5>This type of VR provides an experience partially based in a virtual environment. 
            This type of VR makes sense for educational and training purposes with graphical computing and large projector systems, such as flight simulators for pilot trainees.</h5>

          <h3>Fully Immersive Virtual Reality</h3>
          <h5>Right now, there are no completely immersive VR technologies, but advances are so swift that they may be right around the corner. This type of VR generates the most realistic simulation experience, from sight to sound to sometimes even olfactory sensations. Car racing games are an example of immersive virtual reality that gives the user the sensation of speed and driving skills.
            Developed for gaming and other entertainment purposes, VR use in other sectors is increasing.</h5>

        <h2>What Software Does Augmented Reality Use?</h2>
            <dl>
                <dt><b>1. Unity</b></dt>
                <dd>Unity's real-time 3D development platform lets artists, designers, and developers collaborate to create amazing immersive and interactive experiences.</dd>
                <dt><b>2. Vuforia SDK</b></dt>
                <dd>Vuforia Engine is the most widely used platform for AR development, with support for the majority of phones, tablets, and eyewear. Developers can easily add advanced computer vision functionality to Android, iOS, and UWP apps, to create AR experiences that realistically interact with objects and the environment.</dd>
                <dt><b>3. Blender</b></dt>
                <dd>Blender is the free and open source 3D creation suite. It supports the entirety of the 3D pipeline—modeling, rigging, animation, simulation, rendering, compositing and motion tracking, even video editing and game creation.</dd>
                <dt><b>4. SparkAR</b></dt>
                <dd>Spark AR Studio is an augmented reality platform for Mac & Windows that allows you to somewhat easily create AR effects for mobile cameras.</dd>
