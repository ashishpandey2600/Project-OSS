        <h1>What is <br> Mixed Reality</h1>
        <p >Mixed Reality is the merge of real and virtual worlds to produce new environments and visualizations where physical and digital objects co-exist and interact in real time. For example – picture a surgeon having a digital overlay while performing an operation, providing detailed live information on the process and the current state of the patient like blood pressure and other vital insights.</p>
        <p >The term mixed reality was coined by Microsoft when they launched the Microsoft HoloLens in 2016. Apart from being head mounted mixed reality also stands out from Augmented Reality through a more advanced understanding of the physical space and ability to place holograms in that space. </p>

            There are two main types of devices that deliver Windows Mixed Reality experiences: <br><br>

1. <b>Holographic devices</b> are characterized by the device's ability to display digital objects as if they existed in the real world.<br>
2. <b>Immersive VR devices </b> are characterized by the device's ability to create a sense of presence by blocking out the physical world and replacing it with a fully immersive digital experience.

        <h2>Remote support</h2>
        <p style="width: 70%; margin: auto;">
            <b>Get superpowers with mixed reality</b>: Remote support and remote collaboration using mixed or augmented reality is a superpower for frontline workers. Experts from anywhere in the world can see what they see and guide them to perform any task by voice, video and adding notations in a digital layer on top of the real world.
        </p>
        <h2>Training</h2>
        <p style="width: 70%; margin: auto;">
            
        <b>Training in VR:</b> Virtual reality is the most effective tool for training and onboarding. The immersive experience in virtual reality makes the training experience stick in your memory. With the physical aspect, training in VR beats e-learning and classroom teaching. 
        </p>
        <h2>
            Product Visualization</h2>
        <p style="width: 70%; margin: auto;">
            <b>Visualize it with AR and VR:</b> Virtual reality and augmented reality is the perfect way to visualize products – for marketing, sales, installation, or maintenance purposes. Walk around a digital replica and see your product from all angles or tear it apart for easy step-by-step guidance.

        <h1 style="color: black; font-size: 40px; text-align: left; text-decoration: none;">What is the future of <br> mixed reality? </h1>
        <p>
            Analysts such as Gartner predicts that head mounted mixed reality glasses will over time replace most of the physical screens that we use today including computer screens, smartphones, tablets etc.
<br>
Augmented reality is already available on smartphones and tables. Mixed reality is in its infancy with Microsoft as the market leader and Magic Leap pushing to be the next big contender in the market.
        </p>
        <p>
            Mixed reality has the potential to beam team members into shared spaces with their colleagues through holographic representations. It can also allow a global workforce of remote teams to work together on a virtual model of a product, which they can adapt and shape just like a real item
